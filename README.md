# Tensorflow-fine-tune
In the process of using tensorflow, we often use trained models. We can use the trained model directly for testing or further fine-tuning.
* What does the model mean?
* How to save the model?
* How to recover the model?
* How to fine tune?

How to use the repository？
===
* first, git clone git@github.com:hiJulie/Tensorflow-fine-tune.git
* then, download the .ckpt file from [releases](https://github.com/hiJulie/Tensorflow-fine-tune/releases)
* put vgg_16.ckpt in save_models/
* now，you can run all the code in the file
